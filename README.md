# Snowflake Python Functionality

Collection of Snowflake Stored Procedures and UDFs that leverage Python.

## Stored Procedures

- Execute a Snowflake METADATA command into a destination table
- Demonstrating simple concepts
  - Multiply an integer by three
  - Multiply two integers together
  - Multiply all integers in an array by another integer
  - Retrieve current user and date
  - Create and modify a table via the SQL method
  - Use variables whilst creating and modifying a table via the SQL method
  - Basic version of executing a Snowflake METADATA command into a destination table
  - Example of manipulating data with Pandas
  - Generate a key pair for user authentication and apply it to a user (not best practice as private key may be visible in logs)

## UDFs

- Multiply an integer by three
- Multiply two integers together
- Multiply all integers in an array by another integer
- Generate Snowflake-compliant key pairs for authentication
- Generate fake names
- Example to leverage external files via a mapping table
- Example to leverage external libraries via xlrd.xldate
